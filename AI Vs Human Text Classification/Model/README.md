# AI vs Human Text Classification

**GOAL**

The aim of this project is to classify text into two categories: AI-generated or human-written. 

**DATASET**

[AI vs Human Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text)

**DESCRIPTION**

The dataset consists of text samples labeled as either AI-generated or human-written. It includes a balanced collection of text data representing both classes.

**WHAT I DID**

I conducted extensive data preprocessing tasks, including text cleaning and tokenization. Word2Vec was used for feature extraction from the text data. Subsequently, I split the dataset into training and testing sets and constructed both Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for classification.

**MODELS USED**

The models developed are:

1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- re
- nltk
- gensim
- keras

**CONCLUSION**

Both ANN and LSTM models were successfully built and trained to classify text as AI-generated or human-written. The LSTM model exhibited slightly better performance with an accuracy of around 87% on the test dataset. No transfer learning techniques were employed as satisfactory results were achieved using standard deep learning architectures.
