## **AI Generated vs Real Images Classification using DL**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The objective of this project is to classify images, on whether they were AI generated or real images with human background like paintings and pictures.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 2 subfolders each with a subdirectory leading to the images. Images have been reshaped to 224X224 pixels for modelling.

### 🧾 **Description**

The project deals with binary classification, classifying images into the two classes: AIArt or RealArt.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals, following were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized into the range (0 to 1).

- Images have been set to a fixed size of 224X224 pixels.

- Custom as well as pre-trained models were used for this task.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

models used:

- ResNet-50
- Xception
- VGG16
- CNN-Keras
- Inception

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**

### 📈 **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**

Metrics:

| Models | Accuracy | Loss |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| ResNet-50 | 60.96% | 0.6848 |
| inception | 76.71%  | 0.4543 | 
| CNN | % | 0. |
| Xception | 75.34%  | 0.5466 | 
| VGG16 | 78.77% | 0.5400 |

### 📢 **Conclusion**

We conclude the following:

VGG16 and inception work well on the dataset.
