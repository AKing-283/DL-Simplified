## **Framing the Future**

### üéØ **Goal**
The main objective of this project is to predict future frames in a sequence of Moving MNIST dataset using Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model. The ConvLSTM architecture is capable of capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for this task.

### üßµ **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Moving MNIST dataset, which consists of sequences of handwritten digits moving within a frame. Each sequence contains multiple frames, and the goal is to predict the subsequent frames based on the previous ones.

### üßæ **Description**

This project involves building a ConvLSTM model to predict future frames in Moving MNIST sequences. It includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and prediction on unseen examples.

### üßÆ **What I had done!**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model training.
   - Loaded the Moving MNIST dataset and performed basic exploratory data analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized the first few sequences in the dataset to understand the nature of the data.

3. **Dataset Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation.

4. **Data Normalization**:
   - Normalized the pixel values of the dataset to the range [0, 1].

5. **Model Creation**:
   - Designed a ConvLSTM model architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies in the Moving MNIST sequences.
