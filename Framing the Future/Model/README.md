## **Framing the Future**

### üéØ **Goal**
The main objective of this project is to predict future frames in a sequence of Moving MNIST dataset using Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model. The ConvLSTM architecture is capable of capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for this task.

### üßµ **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Moving MNIST dataset, which consists of sequences of handwritten digits moving within a frame. Each sequence contains multiple frames, and the goal is to predict the subsequent frames based on the previous ones.
