# Polyp Segmentation in Endoscopy Images using UNet, ResUNet, and DeepLabV3+ üè•üî¨

This project focuses on the automated segmentation of polyps in endoscopy images using three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: UNet, ResUNet, and DeepLabV3+. By accurately identifying and delineating polyps, this work aims to assist medical professionals in early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer.

## What is a Polyp? üîé

Polyps are abnormal tissue growths that arise from mucous membranes, commonly found in organs such as the colon, stomach, and intestines. While many polyps are benign, some can develop into cancer, making early detection and removal crucial for preventing colorectal cancer and other serious conditions.

## Importance of the Subject üí°

Early detection and accurate segmentation of polyps during endoscopy are vital for:
- Preventing colorectal cancer
- Improving patient outcomes
- Reducing the risk of complications

Automated polyp segmentation aids gastroenterologists in identifying and removing polyps efficiently.

## Methods üõ†Ô∏è

This project utilizes three different architectures for polyp segmentation:
- **UNet**: A convolutional network designed for biomedical image segmentation with an encoder-decoder structure and skip connections.
- **ResUNet**: An extension of UNet with residual blocks for improved feature extraction and segmentation accuracy.
- **DeepLabV3+**: A deep convolutional network that uses atrous spatial pyramid pooling and an encoder-decoder structure for precise segmentation.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset consists of endoscopy images and their corresponding ground truth images, which indicate the presence and location of polyps.
