# Dataset: CVC-ClinicDB 🏥🔬

The CVC-ClinicDB dataset is a comprehensive collection of frames extracted from colonoscopy videos, specifically designed for the task of polyp segmentation. This dataset provides several examples of polyp frames along with their corresponding ground truth masks, facilitating the development and evaluation of automated polyp segmentation algorithms.

## Dataset Description 📊

The CVC-ClinicDB database consists of two different types of images:

- **Original Images:** These are the original frames extracted from colonoscopy videos, showcasing the regions of interest where polyps may be present.
- **Polyp Mask Images:** These images contain the ground truth masks corresponding to the polyp regions in the original images. Each mask highlights the exact area covered by the polyp in the respective frame.
